## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

 It started with a general idea for the game involving user-navigated biomes with added challenge of quizzing the user on biome facts. We began by creating the biome class and the subclasses for each individual biome, then building the game loop with guava to navigate between biomes, adding in the riddles for each species. We then built the lab to store the inventory, finally adding in graphics for the lab and the biome as the user travels through the game.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

Adding graphics and using guava were both new challenges when completing this project.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

 I think there possibly could have been fewer classes to work with, however, having separate classes for our different elements made it easier to keep track of work and separate the different aspects of the game.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

 I think it would be cool to have more graphics and/or more interactive graphics. With more time, we could have added graphics for the found animals/plants, or even the monsters as they approached.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

I think the most helpful feedback I received was from Mikayle, whose project inspired the added level in our game beyond the riddles. We needed a more "locked" aspect of the game beyond not being able to get to certain biomes from others, so it was helpful to see their game and add the integer "quiz" portion of the game.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

 I think I would advise my past self that our ideas for the project can evolve as we work. I think we went in with a solid plan, but did not originally go as planned, so we had to change how the biomes and lab were built.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

 I think our team worked well together. We both brought a lot of really good ideas to the project and did well to collaborate and let ourselves be more creative with the concepts. We worked both independently and together, and were able to get things done in a timely manner.
