You are surrounded by lush green foliage. You cannot see the sky above the forest canopy, but you feel a light sprinkle of rain. Birds are heard in the distance and you notice Dr. Athene. She drops a slip of paper that you begin to read...

***RIDDLE***
I am brightly colored, but don't be deceived,
I'm not here for your eyes to be pleased.
My skin is toxic, so beware,
Touch me and you'll be in despair.
What am I?
