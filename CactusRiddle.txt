The camel might be safe, but his dear comrade isn't. Dr. Strix appears from above and lands on the sand in front of you. She begins to recount the following riddle.

***RIDDLE***

In the desert, I'm prickly and tiny.
My shape is unique, you cannot mistake,
I can survive in the heat, with very little to take.
What am I?
