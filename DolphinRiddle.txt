You are in an underwater realm surrounded by long and colorful fish. Dr. Athene Strix descends next to you in scuba gear that matches your own. She holds up a card displaying the following riddle:

***RIDDLE***

A mammal in waters, I call my home.
With echolocation, I navigate,
In ocean's vastness, I dominate.
What am I?
